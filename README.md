Studying the gravitational wave signatures for nnatrualness

The uploaded files serve the following purposes:

reheatonToDiboson01.nb

This file carries out the calculation of the form factors for the scalar mediated loop decay that occurs in the positive higg's mass squared sectors. 

reheatonLoopDecay.nb

This file takes the calculated form factors and determines the decay width of the reheaton to "exotic" (positive higg's mass squared) sectors given inputs such as the reheaton mass. The decay width of the reheaton to our own sector is also calculated and used to determine the relative energy densities of the sectors.

QCDPTNNxx.nb

These files contain calculations pertinent to the QCDs of all sectors within the nnaturalness (NN) model. The different versions (xx), each deal with different NN scenarios.

01: Basic NN
02: Close exotic sector
03: Linear in Higg's mass
04: Clustered exotic sectors

cosmicHistoryAndGWxxxxx.nb

As the title suggests, these files compute (and out put the relevant variables) the cosmological history for the different scenarious considered above. 

02: Basic NN
CES: Close exotic sector
03: Linear in Higg's mass
Clus: Clustered exotic sectors
