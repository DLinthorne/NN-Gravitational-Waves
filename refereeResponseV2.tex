We thank the referee for their valuable comments, and we have made changes to the manuscript to address them. 

As the referee mentioned, at large values of $\beta/H$ the phase transition duration can be short when compared to the intrinsic time scale in the fluid and, as a result, the sound waves that act as GW sources may be active for a much shorter duration than the Hubble time. The relevant references have been added to the appendix, along with a comment discussing how at large $\beta/H$ the traditional GW profile may overestimate the sound wave contribution. Since our paper focuses on the unique spectral shapes (and not the amplitude) formed in these models, additional analysis of this regime is beyond the scope of this work.
